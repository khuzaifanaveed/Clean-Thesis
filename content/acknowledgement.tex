%First and foremost, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my promotor, Prof. Dr. Archisman Ghosh, for his guidance, support, and insightful feedback throughout this project. I am especially thankful for his flexibility and willingness to accommodate my schedule, which enabled me to work effectively under my own constraints. I am particularly grateful to my day-to-day supervisor, Cezary Turski, whose mentorship, patience, and consistent encouragement were instrumental throughout every phase of this thesis. His feedback, technical guidance, and responsiveness were key in helping me navigate both conceptual challenges and practical implementation. I deeply appreciate the time and effort they invested in my progress, and their understanding in adjusting to my working rhythm.
%
%I am also thankful to the GWCats collaboration for providing a valuable forum of expertise and exchange that informed several aspects of this research. A special thanks goes to Prof. Marcelle Soares-Santos for her early advice and for introducing me to the \texttt{BUZZARD} mock catalog, which shaped an important part of this thesis.
%
%I gratefully acknowledge the use of computational resources provided by the LIGO Laboratory computing clusters, which enabled the analysis performed in this work. Special appreciation is due to the developers and maintainers of the \texttt{gwcosmo} pipeline, the \texttt{GWSim} package, and the galaxy catalogs used in this work, including \texttt{GLADE+} and \texttt{BUZZARD}, whose open resources made this research possible.
%
%On a personal note, I am deeply grateful to my family for their unwavering support. In particular, I would like to thank my parents, whose love, encouragement, and sacrifices have made all of this possible. I am especially thankful to my mother, whose genuine interest in my work, despite having no background in the field, has always meant a great deal to me. Their belief in me has been the foundation of my academic journey, and I dedicate this work to them with immense gratitude. I also like to thank my friends for their timely distractions and unwavering companionship, which served as crucial reminders that there is, in fact, life beyond academic jargon and late-night analyses.
%
%Finally, I would like to thank everyone who contributed, directly or indirectly, to the successful completion of this thesis. Your support has meant more than words can convey.
