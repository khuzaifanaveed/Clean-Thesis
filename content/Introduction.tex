\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:introdustion}

\section{The Hubble Tension}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Explain traditional methods of measuring $H_0$ (e.g. SNe, CMB, BAO)
    \item Discuss the discrepancy between local measurements (e.g. SNe) and CMB measurements
    \item Introduce the concept of the Hubble tension and its significance in cosmology
\end{itemize}

\section{Standard Siren Cosmology}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Explain the concept of standard sirens and their role in cosmology
    \item Discuss the use of gravitational waves (GWs) as standard sirens
    \item Introduce the idea of using electromagnetic (EM) counterparts to improve distance measurements
    \item Discuss the advantages and limitations of standard sirens compared to traditional methods
    \item Shorter expalantion compared to chapter 2
\end{itemize}

\section{Thesis Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Explain the core idea of the thesis: using brightness-ranked galaxy catalogs to improve the precision of $H_0$ measurements
    \item Discuss the motivation behind using brightness-ranked catalogs
    \item BUZZARD
\end{itemize}
