I hereby declare that this thesis is the result of my own work and has not been submitted for any degree or qualification at any other academic institution. All sources of information used have been appropriately acknowledged and referenced.

I affirm that the research, analysis, and implementation described in this thesis were conducted independently. To improve the clarity, grammar, and structure of the text, AI-based language models (such as ChatGPT and Gemini) were used for language refinement. Furthermore, an AI tool was employed to generate code for one specific figure within this thesis, focusing on its visual representation rather than the underlying data analysis or scientific interpretation. The intellectual contributions, scientific insights, and conclusions presented in this work are entirely my own.
