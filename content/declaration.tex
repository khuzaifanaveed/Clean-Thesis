I hereby declare that this thesis is the result of my own work and has not been submitted for any degree or qualification at any other academic institution. All sources of information used have been appropriately acknowledged and referenced.

I affirm that the research, analysis, and implementation described in this thesis were carried out independently. To improve the clarity, grammar, and structure of the text, large language models (such as ChatGPT and Gemini) were used for language refinement. In addition, generative AI was employed to assist in generating code for one specific figure, limited to its visual representation. These tools were not used for scientific interpretation or data analysis.

All intellectual contributions, scientific reasoning, and conclusions presented in this work are entirely my own.
